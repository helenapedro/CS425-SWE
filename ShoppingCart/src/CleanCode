What I changed and why (Clean Code reasoning)
    1. Meaningful names:
        - CartLine → CartItem,
        - getT() → totalPrice(),
        - productnumber → productNumber.
    2. Single Responsibility + small methods:
        - removed the action(Product, String) method (which mixed add/remove/print behavior
        and used stringly-typed commands).
        - replaced it with explicit addProduct, removeProduct, printContents. Each method does one clear thing.
    3. Product is immutable:
        - made Product fields final, removed setters.
    4. Money correctness:
        - switched to BigDecimal for price arithmetic to avoid floating-point rounding issues.
    5. Encapsulation:
        - CartItem encapsulates the logic about changing quantity (incrementQuantity, decrementQuantity)
        so the cart does not manipulate quantities directly.
    6. Defensive programming:
        - constructors and public methods validate arguments and throw IllegalArgumentException when called
        with invalid input (null product, zero quantities).
    7. Avoid magic strings:
        - removed string commands like "add", "remove", "print".
    8. Small helper method for lookup:
        - findByProductNumber returns an Optional<CartItem>;
    9. toString / equals / hashCode:
        - added useful toString and proper equals/hashCode for Product and CartItem.
